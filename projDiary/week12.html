                    <h6>&#9830; Summary</h6>
                    <p>This week, I worked on two things.</p>
                    <p class="point">• using svgs for my icons instead of emojis & special entities</p>
                    <p class="point">• working on the download function</p>
                    <p>I thought the svg bit was frustrating at first. On hindsight, the download function has to be THE most frustrating thing I've encountered in this project.</p>
                    <h6>&#9830; svgs & raphael</h6>
                    <p>I read somewhere that we can't use any other svg libraries? Anyway, what I did was illustrate my own icons in Adobe Illustrator and save them as svgs. Then, I opened the svg files in VSCode and copied the path. I followed the documentation mostly, and a lot of trial and error. It's still not complete because if you press Lock All & Unlock All, it still uses the emoji. I forgot about those, will change them next week.</p>
                    <h6>&#9830; download button</h6>
                    <p>I'm going to focus on writing about this function this week because the other stuff I did definitely did not trip me up as much as this one.</p>
                    <p>Generally, this is what I wanted download() to do:</p>
                    <p class="point">1. Click the button</p>
                    <p class="point">2. Create a canvas element called exportCanvas where everything that needs to be downloaded will be assembled</p>
                    <p class="point">3. Test which charts have ticked checboxes</p>
                    <p class="point">For ticked checkboxes...</p>
                    <p class="point">4. Get the canvas with the corresponding chart</p>
                    <p class="point">5. Get the base 64 string for the chart</p>
                    <p class="point">6. Draw the chart into exportCanvas using the base 64 string</p>
                    <p class="point">7. When all the charts are drawn into exportCanvas, download exportCanvas</p>
                    <h6>&#9830; Getting the charts to show up on another canvas (exportCanvas)</h6>
                    <p>I tried writing the loop that would test if the checkbox was checked. I tested the function by adding an EventListener to the download button to call ifChecked() when clicked. The if condition wouldn’t work. The strings were generated when the if statement was commented out though.</p>
                    <p><img src="resources/ifChecked1.jpg"></p>
                    <p>Then I realised it was because I should set my if condition to <code> checkboxArr[x].checked == true </code> instead. And it worked!</p>
                    <p>Now I had to find a way to draw this string into exportCanvas (I changed the name from exportImg so that it’s a little clearer). I decided to remove the for loop in ifChecked since I would also need the for loop to do things like drawing the chart onto exportCanvas, so it would make more sense if I had the for loop in the “command center” function download().</p>
                    <p>When I tried organising the functions together in download(), I got this error:</p>
                    <p><img src="resources/download1.jpg"></p>
                    <p>I thought maybe we can’t use base64 strings to draw on canvases? I then decided to change my approach for this part of the algorithm:</p>
                    <p class="point">1. Get a reference URL to the chart</p>
                    <p class="point">2. Set this reference URL as the img src in exportCanvas</p>
                    <p>I thought maybe we could draw with img src based on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54555636/draw-image-to-canvas-and-encode-it-via-base64">this thread</a>. However, I got the same error upon replacing <code>toBase64Image()</code> with <code>toDataURL().</code></p>
                    <p>I did more reading and realised I had to create a new HTML image before setting its source as the URL for the chart image. Then I could draw this image onto exportCanvas.</p>
                    <p><img src="resources/download2.jpg"></p>
                    <p>When I tried this, it yielded two things:</p>
                    <p class="point">1. A blank image</p>
                    <p class="point">2. Returned the url multiple times</p>
                    <p>I decided to get rid of ifChecked() and just move the if condition into download() too, like with the for loop. Otherwise I think it would create empty images for the other unticked graphs too.</p>
                    <p>I suddenly started getting .toDataURL is not a function errors. It didn’t matter whether I used <code> checkboxArr[x], checkboxArr[0]</code> or even the chartjs chart variable name directly like <code>lnPrvw.toDataURL</code> I don’t know why it suddenly decided to stop working, but I decided to just change canvasArr to:</p>
                    <p><code> const canvasArr = Array.from(document.getElementsByClassName("canvasBox"));</code>. canvasBox was a class I had attached to all the canvases storing the chart images for styling.</p>
                    <p>It still didn't work, so I Googled more. After reading <a href="https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/2743">this thread</a>, I realised that maybe I had to use <code>toBase64Image()</code> within the chart declaration, so that the conversion happened after the chart is loaded. Then, I could push that base 64 string into an array.</p>
                    <p>It was a very frustrating process because I couldn’t even check using Chrome if the base 64 string that is pushed into imgData will create the correct image because copy and pasting the string into the searchbar yielded a 404 error. If I copied and pasted the <em>same</em> string through a direct console.log rather than through an array, the image does show up. I resorted to an if statement to test if the two were equal.</p>
                    <p><img src="resources/download3.jpg"></p>
                    <p>They were, so at least now I’m able to get data that actually shows something other than a white rectangle.</p>
                    <p>Also, there didn’t seem to be any full working solutions to my problem that I could find on Google, so I took bits and pieces to try and understand what was going on. This is what I ended up with:</p>
                    <p><img src="resources/download5.jpg"></p>
                    <p>The image of the linechart was huge, so I decided to add some styling. Maybe that will make it smaller. exportCanvas width was 1080, so each chart should take up 1080 / 3 = 360 to fit 6 of them in 2 rows. I tried doing this in <code>new Image(360, 360)</code>, but it had no effect. So I did more googling and found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15793702/drawing-image-on-canvas-larger-than-real">that we shouldn't use strings to determine px values for height & width</a>. I also referred to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/canvas_drawimage.asp">W3Schools</a>, where I learned that I might have to use <code>setAttribute()</code> instead of <code>.style</code> to set the height and width of exportCanvas. Then, I set the width and height of the drawn chart on the exportCanvas to 360px each with this line <code> ctx.drawImage(chartImg, 0, 0, 360, 360);</code></p>
                    <p>It worked! Now, I have to put in the if condition and for loop. The hardest part was to set the coordinates for drawImage() such that each chart started after the next one.</p>
                    <p>Each chart width was 360 (for now, may change in future). In any case, it’s a constant. It’s a bit hard to explain the math in words so I’m going to put the sketch I did to figure it out here:</p>
                    <p><img src="resources/download6.jpg"></p>
                    <p>I had to make a separate counter instead of using the x value because maybe people will select different charts and the order of the charts to be downloaded won’t necessarily be the same as the array.</p>
                    <p>So, I set up a counter in download(), with <code>counter += 1</code> for every chart that was ticked. At first, I placed it outside the <code>chartImg.onload</code> function and was very frustrated when a <code>console.log(counter)</code> within the <code>chartImg.onload</code> function showed the counter perpetually at 6. A <code>console.log(counter)</code> outside the <code>chartImg.onload</code> function would show 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. I decided to just put the <code>counter += 1</code> inside the <code>chartImg.onload</code> function and it miraculously works. I guess because if it’s outside, the counter doesn’t add 1 for each chartImg.onload but just adds 6 times because it's in the for loop.</p>
                    <p>I continued getting errors:</p>
                    <p><img src="resources/download7.jpg"></p>
                    <p>I figured it was because I was still using x to determine the x coordinates, which wasn’t very dynamic. So I decided to initialise the counter at -1 and use counter to replace x in ctx.drawImage(chartImg, 360 * counter, 0, 360, 360); This would sync the counter to start at 0, like x, but also allow it to adapt to the situation of which charts were ticked.</p>
                    <p>I also included this line <code> ctx.clearRect(0, 0, exportCanvas.width, exportCanvas.height); </code> at the start of download(). I got it <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2142535/how-to-clear-the-canvas-for-redrawing">from this thread</a> and it clears the canvas each time download() is called. What this means is that users are able to change their mind about what charts they want to export without having to refresh the page and losing the colours – they just have to tick their new selection and press download.</p>
                    <h6>&#9830; Actually downloading exportCanvas</h6>
                    <p>After hours of searching and trial & error, I found <a href="https://www.sanwebe.com/snippet/downloading-canvas-as-image-dataurl-on-button-click">this page</a> that provides some code on how to download a canvas as an image. But, the page did not have much explanation. So I used chatGPT to teach me what it meant, especially the part with <code>.replace(“image/png”, “image/octet-stream” </code>.</p>
                    <p><img src="resources/download8.jpg"></p>
                    <p>According to chatGPT, doing this changes the MIME type from image/png in dataURLs to image/octet-stream. Octet-stream means "a stream of bytes", which allows the browser to download the image. I’m guessing that browsers can’t download dataURL data properly and this replacement converts it to data that the browser can download.</p>
                    <p>When I tested it with exportCanvas, it wouldn’t work. However, when I tested it with <code> document.getElementById("lnPrvw");</code>, I was actually able to download the linechart. So there must be something wrong with how I’m using exportCanvas. I had no clue what that could be, and Googling wasn’t turning up anything. </p>
                    <p>So I copy-pasted my dlUrl() code into chatGPT and asked it why my exportCanvas was downloading blank. One of the possible causes it suggested, which I also suspected was true, was that exportCanvas had not finished rendering before the dataURL is generated and stored in img. ChatGPT suggested wrapping the code in a setTimeout with a delay of 10 milliseconds. This would allow some time for the exportCanvas to finish rendering before the dataURL is generated. </p>
                    <p>I was able to download an image with the charts I ticked, but the buttons needed to be clicked twice. Apparently, it’s because the first click sets off the timer, and the second click actually downloads the image.</p>
                    <p>This irked me, so I did more searching. I found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8404937/drawing-multiple-images-on-one-canvas">this thread</a>, among others, that talked about how promises were a good way to get a bunch of future data together and then passed on to the next bit of code. I'm finding them pretty complex to understand and don’t think I can finish it in time for week 12 submission, so I’ll just leave it as the double click thingy first ;w;</p>
                    <p>Also, I just realised that if I randomise the data, the download function doesn't work either ;; I will have to figure out how to get that solved too. If I can't do that in time, I might just remove my randomise button because I think the download function is more important.</p>
                    <h6>&#9830; Promises </h6>
                    <p>The purpose of using promises was to: make sure all images are loaded before generating the dataURL so that download works properly. For this part of the code, I referenced <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8404937/drawing-multiple-images-on-one-canvas">this stackoverflow thread on loading multiple images</a> and by giving ChatGPT my code and asking it why certain things were breaking. I would then read through the suggestions to see what I thought was likely, and try to resolve them using my own code.</p>
                    <p>ChatGPT suggested using <code>Promise.all</code> in order to make sure all the iamges were loaded. The steps I thought I would take were:</p>
                    <p class="point">1. Create an array of promises (called promises). Each image that has to be loaded will add a new promise object to this array.</p>
                    <p>Now, we only want to create a promise for the chartImg if the chart is ticked. So we have to keep our for loop and if statement. It would read something like this:</p>
                    <p class="point">2. Go through the checkboxes (for loop)</p>
                    <p class="point">3. And if a checkbox is ticked (if statement)</p>
                    <p class="point">4. Create a promise</p>
                    <p class="point">5. Within this promise, include my asynchronous operation, which is probably the code inside chartImg.onload ( adding to the counter & the ctx.drawImage lines)</p>
                    <p class="point">6. Use .then to push the promise to promises</p>
                    <p class="point">7. Remember to add the standard .catch to detect specific errors</p>
                    <p class="point">8. Promise.all(promises).then execute dlUrl()</p>
                    <p>A promise takes 2 arguments, resolve & reject. At first, I thought all my asynchronous operations should be placed inside the promise (without using a chain). It kinda broke when I tried it, so I decided to break it down into a chain.</p>
                    <p>So the promise would only include this:</p>
                    <p><img src="resources/promises3.jpg"></p>
                    <p>According to the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8404937/drawing-multiple-images-on-one-canvas">StackOverflow thread I was referring to</a>, this looks like the standard format for promises used to ensure images are all loaded before the next piece of code is executed.</p>
                    <p>After creating the promise, I chained different .then to it corresponding to each step in the process.</p>
                    <p class="point">1. Add 1 to the counter</p>
                    <p class="point">2. Draw chartImg to ctx</p>
                    <p class="point">3. Push promise into promises</p>
                    <p>Outside the for loop, <code>Promise.all(promises)</code> is used to check if all the chartImgs have been loaded, before executing the dlUrl() function.</p>
                    <p>After doing this, I am able to get the image to download! However, I still have to click the download button twice to start the loading of chartImgs. If I cannot remove the need for the first click to kick off the loading, then I have to do something that can make the image download by itself while maintaining the illusion that it was the button click that caused the download.</p>
                    <p>I decided to break down the rest of <code>download()</code> into .thens as well.</p>
                    <p><img src="resources/promises2.jpg"></p>
                    <p>Initially, I didn’t have the last .then with downloadLink.click. I added it because after asking chatGPT for suggestions on how to prevent the need to double-click, it mentioned that you can try clicking the downloadLink programmatically. I double-checked this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2705583/how-to-simulate-a-click-with-javascript">by looking up what .click() did</a>, and it looked like it would make the program simulate a click. So I gave it a shot.</p>
                    <p>And it worked! Now, you can just click once on the download button to get the download. However, I still have issues such as not being able to regenerate the colours and downloading that new file without refreshing the page, as well as the randomise data issue. It's as though the downloading is limited to one load only. I will have to find a way to get the chartImgs to load each time something changes I think?</p>
                    <h6>&#9830; Debugging Download()</h6>
                    <p>There are a few major issues with download.</p>
                    <p class="point">1. TypeError when #download is clicked twice</p>
                    <p class="point">2. Chart colours don't update if #download is pressed after new colours are generated</p>
                    <p class="point">3. Double downloads after the first time #download is clicked due to the simulated click</p>
                    <p class="point">4. Randomised data doesn't update in the exported image either</p>
                    <h6>&#9830; 1. TypeError</h6>
                    <p>When I clicked #download twice, I got this error:</p>
                    <p><code>TypeError: Failed to execute 'drawImage' on 'CanvasRenderingContext2D': The provided value is not of type '(CSSImageValue or HTMLCanvasElement or HTMLImageElement or HTMLVideoElement or ImageBitmap or OffscreenCanvas or SVGImageElement or VideoFrame)'.</code></p>
                    <p>According to chatGPT, this means that <code>drawImage()</code> is using invalid arguments. This was my line of code for drawImage()</p>
                    <p><code>ctx.drawImage(chartImgArr[counter], 360 * counter, 0, 360, 360);</code></p>
                    <p>The only non-constant values were <code>counter</code> and the data in that index of <code>chartImgArr</code>. I realised that I had initialised counter to -1 outside <code>loadChartImgs()</code>, which mean that counter was not being reset each time <code>download()</code> is called. I tried initialising counter within <code>loadChartImgs()</code> instead and this removed the error.</p>
                    <h6>&#9830; 2. Colours not updating</h6>
                    <p>If colours are not updating, then it could be because the new <code>chartImgData[]</code> is not being passed to loadChartImgs.</p>
                    <p>Upon console.logging <code>chartImgData[]</code> to check if the new base 64 strings for the new charts are being pushed, I noticed that they are different. So it’s about the new <code>chartImgData[]</code> not being passed to <code>loadChartImgs()</code>. The solution would be to tell the code to pass the new <code>chartImgData</code> to <code>loadChartImgs()</code> when the chart colours are changed.</p>
                    <p>I tried adding an eventListener to changeBtn:</p>
                    <p><code>changeBtn.addEventListener("click", loadChartImgs());</code></p>
                    <p>Now, when I press download, I get two files. The first is an image of the previous download, and the second is the file for the correct download. The correct download showed:</p>
                    <p class="point">• the updated chart colours</p>
                    <p class="point">• the correct charts if I changed which charts are ticked</p>
                    <p>However, the exported image doesn't appear to include newly randomised data.</p>
                    <h6>&#9830; 3. Double downloads</h6>
                    <p>The double downloads occured because I needed the simulated click within <code>download()</code>, since the physical click starts the image loading process. I tried moving the simulated click code around to different stages of the promise chain e.g. outside it, or up with <code>loadChartImgs()</code> instead. None of it worked.</p>
                    <p>The second way I approached it was by kicking off <code>loadChartImgs</code> the moment a checkbox is ticked, rather than doing it in download() which is triggered when the button is clicked.</p>
                    <p>I decided to try adding an eventListener to the checkboxes to call <code>loadChartImgs()</code> when the checkbox changes.</p>
                    <p>My third approach was to stop thinking about adding new code, and instead try to focus on what the double download meant from the program's point of view. I realised that:</p>
                    <p class="point">SITUATION: there is a double download that includes the previous export</p>
                    <p class="point">That means the promise for img is fulfilled.</p>
                    <p class="point">So there is a link for the promise to click.</p>
                    <p class="point">So <code>img</code> still holds the link for the previous export</p>
                    <p class="point">Then if I want to get rid of the double download,</p>
                    <p class="point">I have to clear <code>img</code></p>
                    <p class="point">This will signal to the promise chain that that step was not fulfilled</p>
                    <p class="point">And prevent the download on the physical click</p>
                    <p>So I tried adding <code>downloadLink.setAttribute("href", "#");</code> at the start of <code>download()</code>.</p>
                    <p>And it worked! The last error to resolve now is the issue with the randomised data not updating, which I will work on tomorrow.</p>
