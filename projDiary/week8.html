                    <h6>&#9830; Project Title: Charteruse</h6>
                    <p>This title is a play on words from the colour Chartreuse. I thought it was interesting since it's one of the only colours I know with the word chart in it!</p>
                    <p>This project is going to be a colour generator for charts.</p>
                    <h6>&#9830; What does a colour generator do?</h6>
                    <p>A colour generator helps people pick colours by generating random colours.</p>
                    <p>As this project is aimed at colour generation for charts specifically, this means that it would help to have a preview.</p>
                    <h6>&#9830; What are the "rules" of this generator?</h6>
                    <p>I think there should be sufficient colour contrast between the different colours, which can be ensure through maths. I am also looking to apply colour theory so that the palettes come out pleasing.</p>
                    <p>However, if I cannot find/figure out the maths to apply, I think I will go with the scaling function that we learnt in the Colour Generator practice because that function generates very nicely spaced colours along a gradient.</p>
                    <h6>&#9830; What can the user do?</h6>
                    <p>The basic functions of the colour generator are:</p>
                    <p class="point">• being able to generate random colours by clicking a button</p>
                    <p class="point">• being able to see the generated colours on a chart preview (line chart only, fixed data that cannot be edited on the site)</p>
                    <p class="point">• being able to click on individual colour swatches to copy the hex codes.</p>
                    <p>Some optional features that I am looking to add are (in order of priority):</p>
                    <p class="point">• allowing users to save an image of the chart preview and colour palette (can use canvas.toBlob I think?)</p>
                    <p class="point">• allow previews of different chart types either through radio buttons or separate pages (radio buttons preferred)</p>
                    <p class="point">• locking certain colours so that it doesn’t change while the others do</p>
                    <p class="point">• let people change the data to manipulate the chart</p>
                    <h6>&#9830; What does the program do for each user action?</h6>
                    <p>I think this has already been answered in the previous step?</p>
                    <h6>When does the generator end?</h6>
                    <p>Never. Chart-making is the only constant in this world.</p>
