                <h6>&#9830; Overview: What is your final project about?</h6>
                <p>My <a href="week8.html">Week 8 entry</a> goes into quite a bit of detail, but I'll go over some of the more important points again here. My project title is Charteruse, a play on words from the colour charteruse. Charteruse is going to be a colour generator for charts.</p>
                <p>The basic features are:</p>
                <p class="point">• being able to generate random colours by clicking a button</p>
                    <p class="point">• being able to see the generated colours on a chart preview (line chart only, fixed data that cannot be edited on the site)</p>
                    <p class="point">• being able to click on individual colour swatches to copy the hex codes.</p>
                    <p>Some optional features that I am looking to add are (in order of priority):</p>
                    <p class="point">• allowing users to save an image of the chart preview and colour palette (can use canvas.toBlob I think?)</p>
                    <p class="point">• allow previews of different chart types either through radio buttons or separate pages (radio buttons preferred)</p>
                    <p class="point">• locking certain colours so that it doesn’t change while the others do</p>
                    <p class="point">• let people change the data to manipulate the chart</p>
                <p>For this project, I am currently using random placeholder values for the chart as it is only needed as a preview. However, I may make a feature that allows for the user to enter their own data if there is time.</p>
                <p>A very <a href="../finalProj/index.html">basic, ugly version of the app has been partially completed</a> if it's needed for reference!</p>
                <h6>&#9830; Why did I choose this particular project?</h6>
                <p>This project builds on what I learned from trying out the Colour Generator extra practice. <a href="https://nm2207.org/2223S2/e0774837/web/ColorGenProject/index.html">Here's a link to the version I made for that!</a> I really, really enjoyed that project and I was feeling very motivated to try different things with it, which is why I thought it would make for a good final project starting point.</p>
                <p>At first, I thought I would just make a normal colour generator without using charts. But then the project requires us to use charts, and after learning more about how to use Chart.js, I had the idea to make a palette generator focused on linecharts instead of just a general generator.</p>
                <p>Aside from how much I love colours, I also wanted to make this type of tool because I personally have a lot of trouble deciding what kind of colours to use. Initially, when I thought I would be doing a data story, I was already on the lookout for colour palettes that I would be able to use because I knew I would spend a lot of time on that. It's fun for sure to sift through palettes, but I think that time can be better spent elsewhere when on a tight deadline haha! If I make this successfully, I do forsee myself using it for inspiration for charts and data presentations in future.</p>
                <p>As for the skills I would be able to use, I knew from the practice that I would be able to use functions and variables. From my own exploration of how to use <code>getElementByClassName</code>, I learned that I could also use loops to loop through a particular class in order to make changes e.g. looping through an array of div elements with <code>class = "swatch"</code> and changing their background colours.</p>
                <h6>What is the design of Chartreuse?</h6>
                <p>I'm still thinking about what colours I'm going to use. Ironic, I know, but it's because charteruse isn't the best-looking colour out there. I think I will be keeping the palette pretty neutral in general though, so that the colours will show up nicely!</p>
                <p>As for the view, here is a sketch I made:</p>
                <img class="image" src="resources/sketch.jpg">
                <p>I have already started coding though, and it look a little different from the sketch because I added another column to the side where I'll tuck all the options like downloading or radio buttons to swap charts if I implement that feature. The chart preview and swatches still take up most of the page because I want them to be the focus of the app, and for the user not to be overwhelmed by any provided options.</p>

                <h6>New things I have learned so far?</h6>
                <p>You know how you make kids play math-related games to trick them into doing maths? For me, using my interest in colours is helping me cope with the mathing and computational thinking needed to write certain functions e.g. having to look up the formula to convert RGB values to hex codes.</p> 
                <p>I also have to learn more about HSL to write my conditional statements to make sure there's sufficient contrast between the colours. I haven't read too much about it yet, but I think there might be a threshold (if that's the right term?) for the lightness value that can help me write a function that helps the browser decide whether to, for example, use a black or white colourLabel in order for it to be visible agains the swatch. So right after generating the newRGBString for a random colour, I can use this function to test which side of the threshold the colour is on. Depending on that, the colourLabel will be changed accordingly.</p>
                <p>I have also learned quite a bit on how to pay attention to the order of execution of functions. This gave me some problems when trying to get the chart to change colours, but I will save the details for the diary entry or the final write-up!</p>
